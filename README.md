- 👋 Hi, I’m @melissafeeney
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data science, especially NLP/NLU/NLI, deep learning, and transfer learning
- 👩🏻‍💻 I work in customer analytics and data science for Calvin Klein in NYC
- 📚 I recently earned my graduate degree in data science/quant methods from Columbia University in NYC
- ✨ My graduate thesis, entitled *Domain Generalization Abilities of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Models using Transformer Encodings through Transfer Learning* provided me with the opportunity to combine my interests in customer data and natural language processing by considering customer reviews- while getting to research different kinds of transformer-based deep learning language models
